to use the appropriate function instead of child_spawn0.</p><p>Or a branch on line 13 of <code>foreground.c</code> which uses an alternative <code>el_execsequence.c</code>
which passes the signals it receives to its childs.</p><p>If there is no such function, I think this may be implemented as a self-pipe on <code>foreground.c</code>
which either ignores some specified signal or sends the signal to its child.</p><p>If you find any of these solutions appropriate, I&rsquo;ll try to implement it.</p><p>Which solution appeals most to you?</p><hr><blockquote><p>On bash, the editor receives ^C and ignores the signal properly.</p><p>On execline, foreground receives ^C and closes the whole script,

some extra tooling in the presence of job control.</p><p>Your problem here is that you have an interactive program, editor,
that can receive job control commands while running in the same
process group as the whole script, so job control commands, which
send signals to the process group, affect the whole script instead of
just the editor process. You need to run editor in another process
group (or another session).</p><p>To achieve that, replace &ldquo;foreground { editor ${file} }&rdquo; with
&ldquo;foreground { setsid editor ${file} }&rdquo;.</p><p>That will create a new session for editor to run in. If you have
s6 installed, you can also use s6-setsid -g instead - that will create
a new process group without creating a new session.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>&ndash;

</code></pre></blockquote><p>Isn&rsquo;t job control the task of commands such as <code>foreground</code> and <code>background</code>?</p><p>Is your opinion that this modified foreground is outside the scope of execline,
ant thus there should it be a toolset for job control?</p><blockquote><pre><code>To achieve that, replace &quot;foreground { editor ${file} }&quot; with

the other half of the answer is spwaning the next process
when the editor exits.</p><p>As of now, on the terminal one needs to use <code>fg</code> to continue the process.</p><hr><p><a href=http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html target=_blank rel=noopener>http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html</a></p><p><a href=https://www.sitepoint.com/the-self-pipe-trick-explained/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.sitepoint.com/the-self-pipe-trick-explained/</a></p><p><a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/177897/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://lwn.net/Articles/177897/</a></p><p><a href=https://www.man7.org/tlpi/code/online/diff/altio/self_pipe.c.html target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.man7.org/tlpi/code/online/diff/altio/self_pipe.c.html</a></p><p><a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27185522' target=_blank rel=noopener>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27185522</a></p></article></main></body></html>
