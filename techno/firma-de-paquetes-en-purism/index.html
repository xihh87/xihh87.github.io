<a href=https://puri.sm/posts/the-librem-key-makes-tamper-detection-easy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>envisioning a system that is able to tell you when your boot has been tampered with</a>.</p><p>There is an improvement opportunity on the timing where the boot components are signed.</p><p>As of now, the boot time components can only be signed on boot,
that means that the process you have to follow is:</p><ul><li>Update packages.</li><li>Reboot (Trust the update has gone well)</li><li>Sign the packages at boot time.</li></ul><p>There may be a mechanism to:</p><ul><li><p>Recognize when packages tamper with boot settings
(This may just be a list including all kernel packages and any package that updates <code>initrd</code>)</p></li><li><p>Update these packages separately from every other package, and first (or ask when the time is right).</p></li><li><p>Update these reduced set of packages, and ask you to insert your key on the device to sign.</p></li><li><p>Sign the packages when they are installed.</p></li></ul><p>That way, you need not reboot in order to sign packages and you know that packages
may only have been installed when your key was inserted.</p><p>This proposal may only benefit those settings where you do not use your Librem key to lock and unlock your computer,
cause in that case it is expected that the key is on the device while running.</p></article></main></body></html>
