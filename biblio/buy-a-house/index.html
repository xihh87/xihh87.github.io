• Is there nearby vacant or unused land? Is the zoning compatible with the existing neighborhood?
• Is the neighborhood free from evidence of change, especially change that would lower values?</p><p>• Has the house been checked for radon contamination, and what was the result? Consider having the house tested yourself.
• Have there ever been toxic-waste dumps nearby?
• Is the area in a f lood plain?
• Is there anything about the house that would lower its value that I should know about?
• Is the roof leaking, and has it ever leaked? What damage resulted?
• What are the heating and cooling costs? Could I see a few years of past bills?
• Does the house need more insulation?
• Is the basement dry? If it has ever f looded, what damage resulted?
• Do fuses blow frequently, or circuit breakers open?
