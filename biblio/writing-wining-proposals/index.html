we should probe to find out what factors they will use to make a decision.
We can uncover their decision criteria rather simply. We just have to ask:</p><p><strong>When you compare different vendors, what is the most important factor for you in choosing one?</strong></p><p>The last time you made this kind of decision,
<strong>what factors did you use to guide your decision?</strong>
What did you look for?
<strong>Did that work for you?</strong></p><p>How can we help them use the estimation heuristic to our advantage?</p><p>First, every proposal should include calculations and graphic displays of ROI,
total cost of ownership, payback period, productivity improvements,
speed of delivery, or other measures of gain.</p><p>Second, provide your decision maker with case studies that show how other customers got big rewards from selecting your products or services.
Quantify the impact your solutions had for those customers whenever possible.</p><p>Third, find out what kind of outcome the key decision maker thinks is most important for his or her company.
Is it increased revenue? Regulatory compliance? Greater customer loyalty?
Extended useful life for critical equipment? Elimination of downtime?
Whatever the customer thinks is important defines the value proposition.</p><p>El libro describe 3 modelos para entender la escritura:</p><ul><li><p>El funnel periodístico</p><p>Introducción que responde las preguntas importantes: ¿Qué? ¿Quién? ¿Cuándo? ¿Cómo? ¿Dónde? ¿Por qué?
