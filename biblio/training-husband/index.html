y reservar la sexualidad para la habitación
para hacerlo feliz.</p><blockquote><p>Women can’t appreciate how important sex is to men.
Men need a strong physical relationship to feel that they are loved.
They want to bring sex into more of their relationship,
but they need reinforcement from the women in their lives
in order to make that happen.</p></blockquote><p>Lista de 10 cosas que la hagan feliz y 3 noches sin orgasmos.</p><blockquote><p>Exceptions exist to every rule, but by and large,
women are better decision-makers than men are.
They are less impulsive, more patient,
and better able to consider all elements and all sides of an issue.</p></blockquote><p>(Esto me recuerda cuando en primaria pensaba que las mujeres tenían mejores temas de conversación y eran más listas externamente)</p><blockquote><p>In my own marriage,
even though he now tries to do everything he can
to keep my life as hassle-free and uncomplicated as possible,
I still contribute immensely.
I am just so much more efficient than he is
that he can hardly keep up with me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Men are happiest when they are wrapped around their woman’s finger.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Men’s emotions and even men’s behavior is very closely related to their sexuality.
By building up his sexual energy but failing to let him release that energy,
you will be impacting his attitudes and behavior towards you
not only that evening, but throughout the days that follow.
You may have to accept it as a leap of faith initially,
but try it and you will see exactly what I mean.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Then one night, after you’ve fooled around
but his sexual energy is still, let’s say ‘at its peak’,
you tell him.</p><p>You tell him what he already knows.
Tell him that things have been going great in the relationship lately.
You feel as though you’ve been communicating better,
the romance is back, he’s more responsive to your needs.
Tell him how happy you are,
how much he’s helped you to reduce the stress in your life,
how he continues to impress and please you more every day.
Nibble on his chest, stroke his hair,
and stroke anything that gets him excited.
Bring him to the brink and then keep him there.
This is exactly where you want him when you tell him.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>male orgasm denial […]
would raise the sexual energy
and tweak the brain chemistry
(my admittedly unscientific metaphor)
of the husband.</p></blockquote><p>Ella toma el control de la relación
primero usando una moneda como instrumento
para mantener la energía sexual en muy altos niveles.
Y luego diciéndole que la relación es mejor si ella toma el mando.
Ella tiene que mantener la dinámica andando.</p><p>To set the right mood for the conversation,
the wife should pick an evening where she knows that she and her husband will be undisturbed.
He should be feverishly excited,
maybe on his second or third night of orgasm denial.
Wait until after any physical,
yet for him anti-climatic,
intimacy has transpired and the cuddling has begun.
This is an opportunity for the wife to talk with her husband
about how he is reacting to all of the changes that are taking place.
She should try to stall any prior attempts to bring a deep discussion on this topic up
until she is really ready to talk about it.
When that night comes,
it is important that she begin by getting some sense from him
as to his reaction to all of this.
Most likely, he will be enthusiastic about their evolving relationship.
He may even end up articulating the new understanding perfectly on his own.</p><p>She should tell him that she loves him dearly.
She should choose her own words
to express how important he is to her
and how much she appreciates
every wonderful thing that he has been doing for her lately.
Hold him in your arms.
Stroke his hair.
Tell him that you have noticed there is something that has changed in the relationship lately.
Has he noticed it, too?
Does he feel that he has been more or less wrapped around her finger in recent weeks?
Is he willing to do anything she asks of him?
Does he love to do things on his own initiative
because he knows that it what she wants, what she expects?</p><p>His opinions will be heard, in fact,
they will often be the basis for your decisions.
He will continue to make most of his own decisions,
you will not micro-manage his life.
You will, however, have veto power over his decisions.
Your word is the final say on every dimension of the marriage.</p><p>Wives should not make it a habit of offering quid pro quo,
something for something,
associations between their husband’s actions and his sexual release.
They should keep the general association in place,
but if they too closely link his behavior to his orgasm,
they will unconsciously put their husbands back in control of his own sexual release.
Wives should be very careful about maintaining this control.
Your control of his sexual pleasure is foundational to this book.</p></article></main></body></html>
