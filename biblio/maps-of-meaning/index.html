Many of the party activists I had encountered were using the ideals of social justice to rationalize their pursuit of personal revenge.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I discovered that beliefs make the world, in a very real way—that beliefs are the world, in a more than metaphysical sense.
This discovery has not turned me into a moral relativist, however: quite the contrary.
I have become convinced that the world-that-is-belief is orderly;
that there are universal moral absolutes (although these are structured such that a diverse range of human opinion remains both possible and beneficial).
I believe that individuals and societies who flout these absolutes—in ignorance or in willful opposition—are doomed to misery and eventual dissolution.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lacking omniscience, painfully, we must make decisions, in the absence of sufficient information.Lacking omniscience, painfully, we must make decisions, in the absence of sufficient information.</p></blockquote><p>La función del juego:</p><blockquote><p>Play creates a world in “rule-governed” fantasy—in episodic or imagistic representation—in which behavior can be rehearsed and mastered, prior to its expression in the real world, with real-world consequences.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What the scholars called a “rational foundation for morality” and tried to supply was, seen in the right light, merely a scholarly expression of the common faith in the prevalent morality; a new means of expression for this faith.
—Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A succession of great scientists and iconoclasts has demonstrated that the universe does not revolve around man,
that our notion of separate status from and “superiority” to the animal has no empirical basis,
and that there is no God in heaven
(nor even a heaven, as far as the eye can see).
In consequence,
we no longer believe our own stories—no longer even believe that those stories served us well in the past.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The fundamental propositions of fascism and communism were rational, logical, statable, comprehensible—and terribly wrong.
No great ideological struggle presently tears at the soul of the world, but it is difficult to believe that we have outgrown our gullibility.
The rise of the New Age movement in the West, for example—as compensation for the decline of traditional spirituality—
provides sufficient evidence for our continued ability to swallow a camel, while straining at a gnat.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When one gives up Christian belief [for example]
one thereby deprives oneself of the right to Christian morality….
Christianity is a system,
a consistently thought out and complete view of things.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Christianity presupposes that man does not know,
cannot know what is good for him and what evil:
he believes in God, who alone knows.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The fundamental tenets of the Judeo-Christian moral tradition
continue to govern every aspect of the actual individual behavior
and basic values of the typical Westerner
—even if he is atheistic and well-educated,
even if his abstract notions and utterances appear iconoclastic.
He neither kills nor steals
(or if he does, he hides his actions, even from his own awareness),
and he tends, in theory, to treat his neighbor as himself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The principles that govern his society (and, increasingly, all others15)
remain predicated on mythic notions of individual value
—intrinsic right and responsibility—
despite scientific evidence of causality and determinism in human motivation.</p></blockquote><p>Las mitologías (y sus sistemas de valor)
ayudaron a nuestros antepasados a sobrevivir y prosperar.
Eso implica utilidad de esos sistemas aún cuando está en contradicción con nuestro sistema formal de pensamiento.</p><blockquote><p>Myth is not primitive proto-science.
It is a qualitatively different phenomenon.
Science might be considered “description of the world with regards to those aspects that are consensually apprehensible”
or “specification of the most effective mode of reaching an end (given a defined end).”
Myth can be more accurately regarded as “description of the world as it signifies (for action).”
The mythic universe is a place to act, not a place to perceive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No functioning society or individual can avoid rendering moral judgment,
regardless of what might be said or imagined about the necessity of such judgment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, the individual cannot live without belief
—without action and valuation—
and science cannot provide that belief.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some moral presuppositions and theories are wrong;
human nature is not infinitely malleable.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Narratives of the known”—patriotic rituals,
stories of ancestral heroes,
myths and symbols of cultural or racial identity
—describe established territory,
weaving for us a web of meaning that,
shared with others,
eliminates the necessity of dispute over meaning.
All those who know the rules, and accept them,
can play the game
—without fighting over the rules of the game.
This makes for peace, stability, and potential prosperity
—a good game.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This means that we have to be able to modify what we understand,
even though to do so is to risk our own undoing.
The trick, of course, is to modify and yet to remain secure.
This is not so simple.
Too much modification brings chaos.
Too little modification brings stagnation
(and then, when the future we are unprepared for appears—chaos).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is for this reason that individuals are highly motivated to avoid sudden manifestations of the unknown.
And this is why individuals will go to almost any length
to ensure that their protective cultural “stories” remain intact.</p></blockquote><hr><p>¿Será que el «significado» está relacionado únicamente con las acciones que podemos tomar?</p><p>El modelo en que el sistema representa al mundo por cambios de su estructura interna,
la descripción del reflejo de reorientación
y la descripción en términos funcionales de «puedo comerlo?» ¿me puede comer? ¿puedo aparearme con esto?
me hace pensar que probablemente las cosas que tienen significado para nosotros están en los actos.</p><p>Que las cosas son significativas en función de nuestros actos.
Que los valores significan cosas sólo en función de nuestros actos.</p><blockquote><p>The notion that we respond in an “instinctively patterned” manner to the appearance of the unknown has profound implications.
These can best be first encountered in narrative form.</p></blockquote><p>(Esto me recuerda meaningness donde establece que el el significado es fluido, nebuloso y tiene patrones.)</p><blockquote><p>It is our personal preferences, therefore, that determine the import of the world
(but these preferences have constraints!).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We can actually only do one thing, at one time,
although we may be motivated by confusing, threatening, dangerous or unpredictable circumstances
to attempt many incommensurate things simultaneously.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Alternatively, something unexpected might signify inconceivable opportunity for expansion of general competence and well-being.
Your old, boring but secure job unexpectedly disappears.
A year later, you are doing what you really want to do, and your life is incomparably better.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Hacemos conocido el territorio por medio de la exploración.</p><p>La respuesta emocional primaria ante lo desconocido es ansiedad y miedo para mantenernos vivos.
Después de eso curiosidad para poder integrarlo al territorio explorado.</p><blockquote><p>The brain may be usefully regarded as composed of three primary units—motor, sensory and affective—
or as constituting a matched pair of hemispheres, right and left.
Each manner of conceptual subdivision has its theoretical advantages; furthermore, the two are not mutually exclusive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Appearance of the unknown motivates curious, hopeful exploratory behavior, regulated by fear,
as means to update the memory-predicated working model of reality
(to update the known, so to speak, which is defined or familiar territory).
The simultaneous production of two antithetical emotional states, such as hope and fear, means conflict,
and the unexpected produces intrapsychic conflict like nothing else.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We can predict the behaviors of others (that is, if they share our stories)</p></blockquote><p>Esto está relacionado con la reflexión de Venkat acerca de que las historias nos hacen predecibles.</p><p>Nuestra relación con las cosas depende de nosotros.</p><blockquote><p>We presume, without thinking, that we group things as a consequence of something about them, rather than as a consequence of something about us.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To know something is to do it automatically, without thinking, to categorize it at a glance (or less than a glance), or to ignore it entirely.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A society “works” to the degree that it provides its members with the capacity to predict and control the events in their experiential field
—to the degree that it provides a barrier, protection from the unknown or unexpected.</p></blockquote><p>Esto mismo ocurre con el lenguaje y es a razón por la que no existen sistemas automáticos de traducción que sean declarativos.</p><blockquote><p>The precise nature of that which constitutes morality still eludes declarative exposition. The moral structure, encoded in behavior, is too complex to completely consciously formulate.</p></blockquote><p>Una organización debe:</p><ul><li>mantenerse a sí misma</li><li>mantener la flexibilidad para adaptarse al cambio</li><li>encontrar el apoyo de sus integrantes</li></ul><blockquote><p>We are conscious enough to destabilize our beliefs and our traditional patterns of action, but not conscious enough to understand them.
If the reasons for the existence of our traditions were rendered more explicit, however, perhaps we could develop greater intrapsychic and social integrity.
The capacity to develop such understanding might help us use our capacity for reason to support, rather than destroy, the moral systems that discipline and protect us.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In some regards, a paradigm is like a game.
Play is optional, but, once undertaken, must be governed by (socially verified) rules.
These rules cannot be questioned, while the game is on
(or if they are, that is a different game. Children arguing about how to play football are not playing football. They are engaging, instead, in a form of philosophy).</p></blockquote><hr><p>Dragon is Cat + Snake + Bird that birds fire.</p><p>La evolución es conservativa y usamos el mismo circuito para representar lo desconocido y la maldad dentro de nosotros.</p><p>Los niños disfrutan los chistes desde muy pequeños.</p><p>El humor está relacionado con la verdad
(estás debajo y más allá del desprecio).</p><hr><blockquote><p>“I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain”—will encounter a smile and two question marks from a philosopher nowadays.
“Sir,” the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that you are not mistaken; but why insist on the truth?”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Prolonged drought, floods, earthquakes, plagues—nature&rsquo;s most horrifying and arbitrary occurrences—are capable of rendering the most carefully adapted societies impotent at a single blow.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is no simple matter to rebuild social relationships in the wake of new ideas.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We can change how we think, facilely, and without regard for the consequences, partly because we do not understand why we think what we think (because all the facts that govern our behavior are not at our “conscious” disposal) and because the effects of that change are often not immediately apparent.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Degeneration into chaos—decadence—might be considered the constant threat of innovation undertaken in the absence of comprehension and respect for tradition.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Linguistically mediated criticism of the predicates of behavior undermines faith in the validity of historically established hierarchical patterns of adaptation. The final emergent process of the developmental chain of abstraction can be applied to undermine the stability of its foundation. The modern and verbally sophisticated individual is therefore always in danger of sawing off the branch on which he or she sits.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When you throw a sophisticated religious structure,
an unsophisticated religious structures comes up to fill the gap.</p><p><a href=https://youtu.be/4IBegL_V6AA target=_blank rel=noopener>https://youtu.be/4IBegL_V6AA</a></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>This capacity for infinite transcendence,
which is the ability to abstract, and then represent the abstraction, and then abstract from the representation,
and so on, without end, does not come without a cost, as we have previously observed.</p></blockquote><p>-> Esto me recuerda el hecho de que tenemos &ldquo;dos cerebros&rdquo;, uno que se encarga de lo que conocemos
y otro que es creativo intenta imaginar la realidad a partir de lo que conoce
y que se encarga de prepararnos para lo desconocido.</p></article></main></body></html>
