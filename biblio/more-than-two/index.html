necesitas aprender a negociar, establecer límites, generar acuerdos y siempre decir la verdad.
Para tomar decisiones, hay que recordar que las personas son más importantes que las relaciones.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Almost always, communication tends to be most difficult precisely when it&rsquo;s most important.
As the relationship coach Marcia Baczynski has put it,
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re afraid to say it, that means you need to say it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Coercion happens any time you make the consequences of saying no so great that you&rsquo;ve removed reasonable choice.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s also possible that in setting boundaries a partner is being manipulative, using boundary-setting as a way to coerce you.
Withdrawal and silence, classic techniques of emotional blackmail, can initially be difficult to distinguish from healthy boundary-setting.
A person could be withdrawing just to punish you.
But that doesn&rsquo;t change what you should do.
The solution is never to try to force someone to do something they don&rsquo;t want to do.
Thank them, and respect their choice.
If you can&rsquo;t respect their choice, it&rsquo;s time to examine your own boundaries.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most of us are exceptionally good at misunderstanding each other,
misreading each other&rsquo;s tone and intent,
and failing to get our point across.
But usually we don&rsquo;t realize it.
Usually we think we&rsquo;ve communicated just fine, and it&rsquo;s the other person who has a problem.
Passive and passive-aggressive communicators tend to believe they are direct communicators.
And all of us, being humans, are exceptionally good at storytelling:
making up tales to explain things we don&rsquo;t understand without even realizing it.</p></blockquote><p>Non Violent Communication:</p><ul><li>Observación</li><li>Sentimiento</li><li>Necesidad</li><li>Solicitud</li></ul><blockquote><p>Nonviolent communication is, sadly, often abused.
It can paradoxically become a weapon if your motivation is to change another person rather than connect with them.
If you want to explore nonviolent communication, we strongly recommend that you take the time to learn it well.
Start by picking up Marshall Rosenberg&rsquo;s book Nonviolent Communication, and consider enrolling in a workshop (available in many cities).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t help but see the world through our own lenses,
and it&rsquo;s not always obvious where our perceptions of the world diverge from other people&rsquo;s.
A big part of being able to communicate with someone who seems to hold a different worldview, or who has different experiences,
is to listen and ask clarifying questions.
It&rsquo;s tempting to impose our own understanding on other people
—&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying jealousy is all in my head!"—
and if we don&rsquo;t pay attention, we can end up doing this without even being aware of it.
Effective communication succeeds more often when we ask questions than when we tell other people what they&rsquo;re saying
(or, God help us, tell them what they&rsquo;re thinking or feeling).
In practice: &ldquo;It sounds to me like you&rsquo;re saying I have to get over jealousy by myself, is that really what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Because solo poly people place a high emphasis on personal autonomy, things such as veto, hierarchies and rules that constrain how the relationship is allowed to grow are especially problematic.
Most solo polyamorists we have met will not enter such arrangements.
Ironically, people who do seek prescriptive hierarchies and look for &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; partners
will often gravitate toward solo poly people,
erroneously believing that
if solo poly people don&rsquo;t want the trappings of a conventional relationship,
they don&rsquo;t become seriously invested in their relationships.
This misperception often leads to pain.</p><p><strong>The free-agent model can also have a dark side.</strong>
Just as people who try to prescribe a specific relationship structure can misuse boundary language to control others,
people who prefer a free-agent model can use boundaries around their personal decision-making as a way to avoid responsibility for the consequences of what they do.
The choices we make belong to us, but so do their consequences.
<strong>If you emphasize personal autonomy to the exclusion of listening to your partners&rsquo; needs, you&rsquo;re not asserting boundaries, you&rsquo;re being a jerk.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This [pushing back boundaries] is a tricky balancing act, because predators and abusers are skilled at probing boundaries.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t, though, guarantee to a partner that we&rsquo;ll never develop a mental health issue in the future.
When this happens, it is certainly reasonable to ask your partner for help and support.
But remember that your romantic partner is not your therapist.
Expecting a partner to play that role is likely to place a heavy burden on your partner and the relationship,
and unlikely to help you overcome serious issues.
Talking to a qualified mental health professional is far more likely to succeed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.
NELSON MANDELA</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Many other factors were in play, as always in the disintegration of a decades-long relationship.
But that veto was like an earthquake at sea, which initiated a tidal wave that would eventually consume everything Celeste and I had built together.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If one partner is finding herself unable to hold to a provision of the agreement,
there&rsquo;s a good chance the agreement needs to be renegotiated to work for all partners
—and not that she is dishonest or doesn&rsquo;t care about the agreement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of course, there are consequences of such zero-sum relationships.
Intimacy will be affected.
And you may have to grieve for what is lost when those boundaries are set.
Those losses may include one or more of your relationships.
But don&rsquo;t blame.
It needs to be okay, in every moment, for your partners to set boundaries—with you, and with each other.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is essentially a practice of mindfulness—being fully present with each of our loves,
and open to the person we’re with in the moment—and it’s an advanced but essential poly skill that isn’t often discussed.
It takes years to become good at. But it makes us better partners.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>First, if you start from the premise that you are an autonomous adult responsible for your own allocation of time,
your partners will be less likely to see you as a commodity to be fought over.
Second, if you start from the assumption that your time is yours until it&rsquo;s given to someone,
this reduces (but doesn&rsquo;t eliminate) the possibility that a partner will see time given to another as a personal loss.
But, perhaps most importantly, when you understand that time spent with a partner is a gift and not an entitlement,
this will help you cultivate a sense of gratitude for it,
and gratitude is a powerful shield against jealousy and fear.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Being in an intimate relationship with someone who is suffering abuse
—especially if you fear for their physical safety—
can cause you trauma.
It&rsquo;s important to set good boundaries for yourself,
care for yourself and avoid getting drawn into the abuse dynamic,
either as a victim or as a rescuer.
Consider talking to a qualified mental health practitioner
—not to help you figure out how to save your partner, but for your own sake.
In some cases, you may need to protect yourself by limiting your involvement in the relationship or withdrawing from it entirely.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The instant my grandmother died, her marriage became a success.
Death parted my grandparents, not divorce, and death is the sole measure of a successful marriage.
When a marriage ends in divorce, we say that it&rsquo;s failed.
The marriage was a failure. Why? Because both parties got out alive.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the parting is amicable,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the exes are happier apart,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter if two happy marriages take the place of one unhappy marriage.
A marriage that ends in divorce failed.
Only a marriage that ends with someone in the cooler down at Maloney&rsquo;s is a success.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Plus, coming out means revealing something deeply personal about yourself,
and that usually works better as part of a private conversation.
A more successful approach might be
&ldquo;You know my friend Marcel, right?
Who I spend a lot of time with? Marcel and I are in a romantic relationship.
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong between Ambrose and me.
Our relationship is excellent, and I&rsquo;m grateful to have his support as I explore my relationship with Marcel.
We&rsquo;re very happy together.
I love you, and it&rsquo;s important for me to be authentic with you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Come out of the closet]
Focus on the positive, without apology or evasion.
You&rsquo;re here to share yourself, not to apologize for being who you are.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Keep your cool, respond calmly that a woman&rsquo;s value doesn&rsquo;t depend on her sex life or being opposed to sex,
and above all, avoid internalizing this kind of judgment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He loved her, of course, but better than that, he chose her, day after day.
Choice: that was the thing.
SHERMAN ALEXIE</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the end, a recipe for successful relationships might look like this:<br>Be flexible.<br>Be compassionate.<br>Rules can never cure insecurity.<br>Integrity matters.<br>Never try to script what your relationships will look like.<br>Love is abundant.<br>Compatibility matters.<br>You cannot sacrifice your happiness for that of another.<br>Own your own shit.<br>Admit when you fuck up.<br>Forgive when others fuck up.<br>Don&rsquo;t try to find people to stuff into the empty spaces in your life; instead, make spaces for the people in your life.<br>If you need a relationship to complete you, get a dog.<br>It is almost impossible to be loving or compassionate when all you feel is fear of loss.<br>Trust that your partners want to be with you,<br>and that if given the freedom to do anything they please,<br>they will choose to cherish and support you.<br>Most relationship problems can be avoided by good partner selection.<br>Nobody can give you security or self-esteem; you have to build that yourself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And if you remember nothing else from this book, remember this: Love more and be awesome.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href=https://www.nonmonogamyhelp.com/thirteen-things-i-wish-id-learned-before-choosing-non-monogamy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.nonmonogamyhelp.com/thirteen-things-i-wish-id-learned-before-choosing-non-monogamy/</a></p><blockquote><p>Another thing that beginner non-monogamous sources fail to really discuss
is the fact that non-monogamous setups where an individual doesn’t spend a long time with any one individual
but sees them rarely can allow for people who would normally be toxic and difficult to be around
to have plenty of ‘functional’ relationships.
If you only see someone once every two weeks and your time with them is great,
you don’t necessarily see or have to deal with some of the more dubious aspects of their personality.</p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
