If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Save your steal for later.</p></blockquote><p>Estudia artistas uno por uno.</p><p>Registra conversaciones escuchadas al pasar.</p><p>Siempre ten un papel contigo.</p><p>Mantén un archivo de cosas de otras personas para tener inspiración.</p><p>See something worth stealing? Put it in the swipe file. Need a little inspiration? Open up the swipe file.</p><blockquote><p>“It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.” —Mark Twain</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No esperes conocerte para empezar.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You might be scared to start. That’s natural. There’s this very real thing that runs rampant in educated people. It’s called “impostor syndrome.”</p><p>The clinical definition is a “psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments.” It means that you feel like a phony, like you’re just winging it, that you really don’t have any idea what you’re doing.</p><p>Guess what: None of us do. Ask anybody doing truly creative work, and they’ll tell you the truth: They don’t know where the good stuff comes from. They just show up to do their thing. Every day.</p><p>Austin Cleon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I love both readings—you have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We’re talking about practice here, not plagiarism—plagiarism is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Copying is about reverse-engineering. It’s like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>McCartney and his partner John Lennon became one of the greatest songwriting teams in history, but as McCartney recalls, they only started writing their own songs “as a way to avoid other bands being able to play our set.” As Salvador Dalí said, “Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>David Letterman tried to copy Johnny Carson but ended up David Letterman. And Conan O’Brien tried to be David Letterman but ended up Conan O’Brien. In O’Brien’s words, “It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique.” Thank goodness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I have stolen all of these moves from all these great players. I just try to do them proud, the guys who came before, because I learned so much from them. It’s all in the name of the game. It’s a lot bigger than me.”
—Kobe Bryant</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I have stared long enough at the glowing flat rectangles of computer screens. Let us give more time for doing things in the real world . . . plant a plant, walk the dogs, read a real book, go to the opera.”
—Edward Tufte</p></blockquote><p>Necesito moverme para que la inspiración nazca.</p><blockquote><p>“The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.”
—Jessica Hische</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Practice productive procrastination.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One time I heard a coworker say, “When I get busy, I get stupid.” Ain’t that the truth. Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I’m bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts—it’s so boring, I almost always get good ideas.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As the artist Maira Kalman says, “Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind.”
Take time to mess around. Get lost. Wander. You never know where it’s going to lead you.</p></blockquote><p>Es importante tener un hobby.</p><blockquote><p>You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.
Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Distance and difference are the secret tonic of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.”
—Jonah Lehrer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To say that geography is no longer our master isn’t to say that place isn’t important. Where we choose to live still has a huge impact on the work we do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“There’s only one rule I know of: You’ve got to be kind.”
—Kurt Vonnegut</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Complain about the way other people make software by making software.”
—Andre Torrez</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Neil Young sang, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.” I say it’s better to burn slow and see your grandkids.</p></blockquote><p>Necesitas una rutina y tu trabajo puede darte una.</p><blockquote><p>The solution is really simple: Figure out what time you can carve out, what time you can steal, and stick to your routine. Do the work every day, no matter what. No holidays, no sick days. Don’t stop. What you’ll probably find is that the corollary to Parkinson’s Law is usually true: Work gets done in the time available.
Nobody’s saying it’s going to be fun. A lot of times it will feel as if you’re living a double life. The poet Philip Larkin said the best thing to do is “try to be utterly schizoid about it all—using each personality as a refuge from the other.”
The trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn’t make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time. Good day jobs aren’t necessarily easy to find, but they’re out there.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what’s really important to them. Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities. The idea that you can do anything is absolutely terrifying.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Telling yourself you have all the time in the world, all the money in the world, all the colors in the palette, anything you want—that just kills creativity.”
—Jack White</p></blockquote><hr><p>[ ] Talk a walk
