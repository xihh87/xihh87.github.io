Assuming not all men were patrons of ladies of the night, you can imagine that those hardworking girls had some steep competition for a narrow market.
Ironically, as we&rsquo;ve become addicted to dating and competing for a narrow market of men who&rsquo;ll commit,
we also shop at a store called Victoria&rsquo;s Secret.</p><p>While families are changing at a fast clip, research still supports the idea that today,
a two-parent family with both partners having a biological interest in the child is the best prescription for successful kids.15
One statistic that might be particularly startling to single mothers who fantasize about a blended family:
One of the most dangerous places for a child in America today is living in a home with a non-biologically related male.
Yep, that&rsquo;s Mommy&rsquo;s boyfriend, husband, or stepson.
Kids in this version of family have eight times the rate of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.16
That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t great stepfathers out there.
It&rsquo;s just a cautionary note that single women with children need to be especially careful and vigilant when choosing a mate.</p><p>Women have so many family-style choices available to them. We can have a cohabiting relationship, a “stay over” relationship, a single mother family, a female breadwinner family, a peer marriage, or an old-fashioned marriage with a male breadwinner. But the key is to choose what&rsquo;s right for you rather than fall into something you didn&rsquo;t bargain for. Every one of these choices has pros and cons and trade-offs that many young women have yet to consider. Bombshell, ladies: Unless you understand the costs and benefits of each kind of relationship, you&rsquo;re playing Russian roulette with your genes. (I told you I&rsquo;d be blunt!)</p><p>Studies show that married men live longer than single men, and this is partly because of the care they receive from a woman.20 I told you we were really goddesses.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the bad news about love. Most men can have sex without any emotional connection. Only some women can do this. In fact, the oldest trade in our species is the one where women attempt to trade sex for love. Women lose every time. In Dory Hollander&rsquo;s book 101 Lies Men Tell Women—And Why Women Believe Them, she says the number one lie that men tell women is “I love you” in exchange for sex.21 Bottom line: Most men compartmentalize sex and love. Of course, those compartments can merge, but rarely after just a few hookups. Renowned evolutionary psychology professor David Buss, PhD, at the University of Texas at Austin and Martie G. Haselton, PhD, at UCLA found that the greater number of previous sexual partners a man has, the more likely he is to quickly perceive diminished attractiveness in a woman after sexual intercourse for the first time. Sex simply doesn&rsquo;t lead to love for men. And if the guy is a player, it more often leads to outright disdain</p><p>In more obvious pain are the gals who really feel the emotional ache of a hookup and pay the price of trying to be cool. A young female graduate student described it this way: “I can&rsquo;t even count the number of girlfriends who&rsquo;ve come to me in tears that their one-night stand never called, never asked them out on a date, never sent flowers. Then, there are the girls who&rsquo;ve dug themselves even deeper into the heartbreak hole—the girls that hook up with the same guy for several months, hoping and longing that one day, he&rsquo;ll commit. None of these girls end up with a commitment, a ring, or even a real date!”</p><p>The biological reason for all this is a pesky hormone called oxytocin. Oxytocin is the female bonding hormone. It&rsquo;s excreted in large doses during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and one other event: female orgasm.22 Women are wired to bond through sex. This longing wasn&rsquo;t created by our imagination or patriarchy or a sexual double standard. It was created through millions of years of evolution to help our species survive. And through sexuality, women have been the custodians of the social order. Lately, it seems, women have quit their jobs as that kind of ruler.</p><p>According to Dr. Gillath, attachment anxiety and emotional avoidance are fueling our addiction to dating. “We know from our studies that insecure people—and especially avoidant individuals—tend to prefer short-term, less committed sexual relationships. I also have some preliminary evidence to show that people in the U.S. are gradually becoming more avoidant (due to things such as high mobility as well as low personal and economic security). Put these things together and you get the increase in hooking up.”</p><hr><ol><li>It&rsquo;s not difficult for me to get close to my partner. - 7 -> 1</li><li>I often worry my partner won&rsquo;t want to stay with me. - 3 -> 3</li><li>I often worry my partner doesn&rsquo;t really love me. - 1 -> 1</li><li>It helps to turn to my romantic partner in times of need. - 7 -> 1</li><li>I often wish my partner&rsquo;s feelings for me were as strong as my feelings for him or her. - 4 -> 4</li><li>I worry a lot about my relationships. - 3 -> 3</li><li>I feel comfortable depending on romantic partners. - 1 -> 7</li><li>When I show my feelings for romantic partners, I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t feel the same about me. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I rarely worry about my partner leaving me. - 7 -> 1</li><li>My partner only seems to notice me when I&rsquo;m angry. - 2 -> 2</li><li>I talk things over with my partner - 5 -> 3</li><li>I don&rsquo;t often worry about being abandoned. - 7 -> 1</li><li>My romantic partner makes me doubt myself. - 4 -> 4</li><li>I find that my partner(s) don&rsquo;t want to get as close as I&rsquo;d like. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll lose my partner&rsquo;s love. - 1 -> 1</li><li>My desire to be very close sometimes scares people away. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I worry I won&rsquo;t measure up to other people. - 3 -> 3</li><li>I find it easy to depend on romantic partners. - 3 -> 5</li><li>I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I feel comfortable sharing my private thoughts and feelings with my partner. - 5 -> 3</li><li>I worry romantic partners won&rsquo;t care about me as much as I care about them. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I find it difficult to allow myself to depend on romantic partners. - 7 -> 7</li><li>I&rsquo;m afraid that once a romantic partner gets to know me, he or she won&rsquo;t like who I really am. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I&rsquo;m very comfortable being close to romantic partners. - 5 -> 3</li><li>I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable opening up to romantic partners. - 3 -> 3</li><li>I prefer not to be too close to romantic partners. - 7 -> 7</li><li>I get uncomfortable when a romantic partner wants to be very close. - 5 -> 5</li><li>I find it relatively easy to get close to my partner. - 6 -> 2</li><li>I usually discuss my problems and concerns with my partner. - 5 -> 3</li><li>I tell my partner just about everything. - 5 -> 3</li><li>Sometimes, romantic partners change their feelings about me for no apparent reason. - 1 -> 1</li><li>When my partner is out of sight, I worry he or she might become interested in someone else. - 1 -> 1</li><li>I&rsquo;m nervous when partners get too close to me. - 3 -> 3</li><li>It&rsquo;s easy for me to be affectionate with my partner. - 7 -> 1</li><li>It makes me mad when I don&rsquo;t get the affection and support I need from my partner. - 3 -> 3</li><li>My partner really understands me and my needs. - 4 -> 4</li></ol><p>Anxiety: (3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3) / 18 = 1.83

Individuals with more partners do not tend to find these relationships that rewarding. Why is that?” muses Dr. Paik. “One answer is that they are built that way. This could be related to their belief about what sex is about. In the old system, they didn&rsquo;t have that much opportunity. The other explanation is that these experiences change their beliefs. We don&rsquo;t know. Is this a cause and effect? Is that brain pattern they are observing a cause or effect?”</p><hr><h2 id=marriage-type><a href=#marriage-type alt>Marriage Type</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol><li>If my child were ill and needed to remain home from school, I&rsquo;d be more likely to stay home with him or her than my mate would. - 3</li><li>Given the structure of our society, it&rsquo;s important that the woman assume primary responsibility for the care of small children. - 3</li><li>I want my future mate to be the main breadwinner in the family. - 2</li><li>My income will be as vital to the well-being of our family as is my mate&rsquo;s. - 3</li><li>I wouldn&rsquo;t work if my mate didn&rsquo;t approve. - 1</li><li>I wouldn&rsquo;t attend a professional convention if it inconvenienced my mate&rsquo;s work. - 3</li></ol><h2 id=domestic-responsibility><a href=#domestic-responsibility alt>Domestic Responsibility</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol start=7><li>Although I&rsquo;ll welcome my mate&rsquo;s help, I think the responsibility for homemaking tasks will be primarily mine. - 3</li><li>If a mother feels she&rsquo;s not meeting her domestic responsibilities due to her career involvement, she should cut back her career demands. - 4</li><li>I&rsquo;ll try not to make demands on my mate that his colleagues wouldn&rsquo;t have to meet. - 1</li></ol><h2 id=satisfaction><a href=#satisfaction alt>Satisfaction</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol start=10><li>I&rsquo;d be a less fulfilled person without my experience of family life. - 3</li><li>Having children isn&rsquo;t a priority for me. - 2</li><li>My career is fulfilling, but I feel it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy me totally without children. - 2</li></ol><h2 id=self-image><a href=#self-image alt>Self-Image</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol start=13><li>Having a career will make me a better mate than I&rsquo;d be otherwise. - 5</li><li>Married professional women have the best of two worlds: professional employment combined with a full family life. - 5</li><li>I think my career will make me a better mother than I otherwise would be. -</li><li>I hope to spend as much or more actual time with my children as my nonworking neighbors who are active in community affairs.</li></ol><h2 id=career-salience><a href=#career-salience alt>Career Salience</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol start=17><li>I view my work more as a job than as a career.</li><li>If my work were cutting into my family life and my husband could support us, I&rsquo;d cut back.</li><li>My career should be as important to my husband as it is to me.</li><li>I&rsquo;m as career-oriented as my male colleagues.</li><li>I&rsquo;d recommend that any young woman contemplating a career complete her professional training before marriage.</li><li>In the case of conflicting demands, a professional woman&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to her husband and children.</li><li>It&rsquo;s possible for a husband and wife to work in separate cities to maximize career possibilities and have a successful marriage at the same time.</li><li>If I were to receive an exceptional job offer in another city (one I wanted to accept), I wouldn&rsquo;t expect my husband to accompany me unless he was sure of a suitable position for himself.</li></ol><h2 id=career-line><a href=#career-line alt>Career Line</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h2><ol start=25><li>A married woman&rsquo;s career history should be considered in light of the two sets of demands she faces as a wife and as a professional.</li><li>Most single career women have greater opportunities to succeed in a profession than do married career women.</li><li>A married woman&rsquo;s career goals tend to be more modest than those of her male colleagues.</li><li>I&rsquo;d cut back on my career involvement in order to meet the needs of my family.</li><li>I think my career would suffer due to the responsibilities I&rsquo;ll have as a mother.</li><li>It&rsquo;s impossible in our present society to combine a career in the fullest sense of the term (uninterrupted, full-time work with a high degree of commitment and desire for success) with the demands of a family.</li><li>I consider myself a working woman (have professional employment) rather than a career woman (to whom advancement and exceptional achievement in a profession are important).</li></ol><hr><p>Ladies, pay attention when a man says he&rsquo;s not ready for a relationship, even if he&rsquo;s being kind and spending time and money on you.

Instead, reprogram your brain with the idea that the “giver” is the power player in life. The receiver isn&rsquo;t a “taker” but is a worthy human being.</p><hr></article></main></body></html>
