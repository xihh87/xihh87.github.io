considerando todas las posibilidades y decidiendo la mejor.
Es tan importante pensar qué vas a hacer como pensar qué no vas a hacer.
Para elegir una estrategia hay que responder las preguntas</p><ul><li>¿En qué consiste ganar?</li><li>¿Dónde jugar?</li><li>¿Cómo ganar?
ver cómo tus capacidades apoyan tus decisiones,
considerar qué harían tus competidores,
los supuestos que harían atractivas las posibilidades,
hacer pruebas para comprobar los supuestos
y actuar en consecuencia.</li></ul><hr><blockquote><p>Winning should be at the heart of any strategy.
In our terms, a strategy is a coordinated and integrated set of five choices:
a winning aspiration,
where to play,
how to win,
core capabilities,
and management systems.</p></blockquote><p>Las 5 preguntas:</p><ul><li><p>What is your winning aspiration?
The purpose of your enterprise, its motivating aspiration.</p></li><li><p>Where will you play?
A playing field where you can achieve that aspiration.</p></li><li><p>How will you win?
The way you will win on the chosen playing field.</p></li><li><p>What capabilities must be in place?
The set and configuration of capabilities required to win in the chosen way.</p></li><li><p>What management systems are required?
The systems and measures that enable the capabilities and support the choices.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Where to play selects the playing field; how to win defines the choices for winning on that field.
It is the recipe for success in the chosen segments, categories, channels, geographies, and so on.
The how-to-win choice is intimately tied to the where-to-play choice.
Remember, it is not how to win generally, but how to win within the chosen where-to-play domains.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Two questions flow from and support the heart of strategy:
(1) what capabilities must be in place to win, and
(2) what management systems are required to support the strategic choices?</p></blockquote><p>Igual que en otros temas,
no es una sola cosa la que hace triunfar a P&amp;G,
sino el conjunto de muchas pequeñas ventajas que juntas les ayudan a dominar el mercado.</p><blockquote><p>These five core capabilities support and reinforce one another and, taken together, set P&amp;G apart.
In isolation, each capability is strong, but insufficient to generate true competitive advantage over the long term.
Rather, the way all of them work together and reinforce each other is what generates enduring advantage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It isn’t entirely easy to make your way through the full choice cascade.
Doing so isn’t a one-way, linear process.
There is no checklist, whereby you create and articulate aspirations,
then move on to where-to-play and how-to-win choices, then consider capabilities.
Rather, strategy is an iterative process in which
all of the moving parts influence one another and must be taken into account together.</p></blockquote><p>Esto me recuerda «A plan is worthless, but planning is everything».
El plan no importa, pero planear lo es todo.</p><p>Es importante responder todas las preguntas
pero también es importante revisarlas.
Es importante decidir qué NO hacer.</p><blockquote><p>“[In IT] you need to be distinctive to avoid commoditization.
We have been on a quest to deliver unique value to P&amp;G.
Whatever is distinctive and unique, we focus on;
whatever is commodity, because there is not competitive advantage in doing it inside, we outsource.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The desire to win spurs a helpfully competitive mind-set, a desire to do better whenever possible.
For this reason, GBS competes for its internal customers.
Passerini explains:
“We don’t mandate new services; we offer them [to businesses and functions] at a cost.
If the business units like them, they will buy them.
If they don’t like them, they will pass.”
This open market provides important feedback
and keeps GBS thinking about how to win with its internal customers and create new value.
So much so that Passerini famously stood at a global leadership team meeting and promised:
“Give me anything I can turn into a service, and I’ll save you seventeen cents on the dollar.”
It was a provocative offer, and one that set the tone for his team.
Good enough wasn’t an option. Providing services wasn’t the strategy.
Providing better services at higher quality and lower costs—while serving as an innovation engine for the company—was the strategy.
It was a strategy aimed at winning.</p></blockquote><p>Uno debe enfocarse en ofrecer valor a sus clientes
en vez de en mejorar sus productos
para evitar perder de vista lo importante.</p><blockquote><p>Or think of a skin-care company.
It is far more likely to say it makes a line of skin-care products
than to say it is in the business of helping women have healthier, younger-looking skin or helping women feel beautiful.
It’s a subtle difference, but an important one.</p></blockquote><p>No hay que detenerse en mostrar la visión,
hay que decidir cómo concretarla.</p><blockquote><p>The push was to ask,
“Who really is your best competitor?
More importantly,
what are they doing strategically and operationally that is better than you?
Where and how do they outperform you?
What could you learn from them and do differently?”
Looking at the best competitor, no matter which company it might be,
provides helpful insights into the multiple ways to win.</p></blockquote><h1 id=qué-es-ganar><a href=#qu%c3%a9-es-ganar alt>Qué es ganar</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><p>No existe un marco para decidir esto.
Pero conviene tomar en cuenta las competencias de los jugadores.</p><ul><li><p>Industria (¿Cuáles son los segmentos? | ¿qué tan atractivos son estructuralmente?)</p></li><li><p>Clientes (Canales | valores del consumidor final)</p></li><li><p>Posición relativa (capacidades | costos)</p></li><li><p>¿Cómo reaccionarían los competidores?</p></li><li><p>Decisión.</p></li></ul><h1 id=dónde-jugar><a href=#d%c3%b3nde-jugar alt>Dónde jugar</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><p>Para decidir dónde jugar, tomar en cuenta
qué tan atractiva es la industria y sus segmentos,
qué valoran los clientes y el canal de venta,
la posición relativa a la competencia,
y cómo reaccionaría la competencia ante tu estrategia.</p><blockquote><p>Don’t expect either the channel or the end consumers to tell you what constitutes value; that is your job to figure out.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where-to-play choices occur across a number of domains, notably these:</p><ul><li>Geography. In what countries or regions will you seek to compete?</li><li>Product type. What kinds of products and services will you offer?</li><li>Consumer segment. What groups of consumers will you target? In which price tier? Meeting which consumer needs?</li><li>Distribution channel. How will you reach your customers? What channels will you use?</li><li>Vertical stage of production. In what stages of production will you engage? Where along the value chain? How broadly or narrowly?</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>A choice to serve everyone, everywhere—or to simply serve all comers—is a losing choice.</p><p>Choosing where to play is also about choosing where not to play.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“We don’t give lip service to consumer understanding.
We dig deep.
We immerse ourselves in people’s day-to-day lives.
We work hard to find the tensions that we can help resolve.
From those tensions come insights that lead to big ideas.”
Those big ideas can be the basis of a powerful where-to-play choice.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do be honest about the allure of white space.
It is tempting to be the first mover into unoccupied white space.
Unfortunately, there is only one true first mover (as there is only one low-cost player),
and all too often, the imagined white space is already occupied
by a formidable competitor you just don’t see or understand.</p></blockquote><h1 id=cómo-ganar><a href=#c%c3%b3mo-ganar alt>Cómo ganar</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><p>Una estructura de precios de bajo costo te permite usar los márgenes de ganancias para ganarle el mercado a la competencia.</p><p>Hay dos estrategias fundamentales:</p><ul><li>Tener la estructura de costo más bajo
e invertir las ganancias en mejorar.
(Sólo el jugador con el precio más bajo puede ganar este juego)</li><li>Diferenciarse (Propuesta Única de Valor)</li></ul><blockquote><p>Having lower costs than some but not all competitors
can enable a firm to stick around and compete for a while.
But it won’t win.
Only the true low-cost player can win with a low-cost strategy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>All successful strategies take one of these two approaches, cost leadership or differentiation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is very difficult to pursue both cost leadership and differentiation,
because each requires a very specific approach to the market.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was everywhere anybody needed consumer insight or anywhere we thought it could add value. Just like a business dilutes its focus and in turn its growth potential when you try to do too many things at a time or do things that are further away from your core strengths, we were relatively diluted in the nature of the impact we could have.”4</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Traditionally, in diapers and elsewhere, the emphasis had been on cutting-edge technology.
Here, the R&amp;D teams had a different challenge
—to address the specific, differentiated needs of consumers in emerging markets within specific cost parameters.
It was a different way of thinking about and using the core innovation capability
—but one on which the R&amp;D teams were able to deliver.
The result was market leadership in China in a rapidly growing category.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do work to create new how-to-win choices where none currently exist.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But don’t kid yourself either.
If, after lots of searching, you can’t create a credible how-to-win choice,
find a new playing field or get out of the game.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>CEO Ed Artzt summarized the lessons of the Pampers story in a strategy class he taught in the early 1990s:</p><ul><li>Determine whether a product innovation is really brand specific or ultimately category generic.
Never give your current brand user a product-based reason to switch away.
By denying Pampers the hourglass shape and better-fit features for a decade,
the brand lost five generations of new parents and new babies.</li><li>Competition will follow your technology, trying to at least match it and ideally beat it.
Technical superiority alone is not sustainable.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Tres preguntas para intentar unir compañías:</p><ul><li>¿El mercado es grande y está creciendo?</li><li>¿Qué valor nos agrega la otra compañía?</li><li>¿Qué valor le agregas a la otra compañía?</li></ul><blockquote><p>The acquisition is only really successful if you’re a better owner of the business
than either the previous owner or the company as an independent company.
That usually gets down to your capabilities,
in our case, your consumer capabilities, your branding capabilities, your R&amp;D capabilities,
your go-to-market capabilities, your global infrastructure, your back office.
Are the capabilities and strengths that you’re bringing to the business going to improve it,
grow it faster,
and create more value than it did before?”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>powerful and sustainable competitive advantage is unlikely to arise from any one capability
(e.g., having the best sales force in the industry or the best technology in the industry),
but rather from a set of capabilities that both fit with one another
(i.e., that don’t conflict with one another)
and actually reinforce one another
(i.e., that make each other stronger than they would be alone).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rather than starting with capabilities and looking for ways to win with those capabilities,
you need to start with setting aspirations and determining where to play and how to win.
Then, you can consider capabilities in light of those choices.
Only in this way can you see what you should start doing, keep doing, and stop doing in order to win.</p></blockquote><h1 id=sistemas-de-actividad><a href=#sistemas-de-actividad alt>Sistemas de actividad</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><blockquote><p>An activity system is of no value unless it supports a particular where-to-play and how-to-win choice.
Again, the various choices along the cascade must be considered iteratively.
You need to go back and forth between the choices.
You can think through a tentative where-to-play and how-to-win choice.
Then you can ask, what activities system would effectively underpin this choice?
Once you lay out such a system map,
you can ask a sequential set of questions about feasibility, distinctiveness, and defensibility.</p></blockquote><p>Tu sistema debe soportar tus decisiones estratégicas,
y debe ser posible, distintivo y defensible.</p><blockquote><p>In addressing feasibility, ask several questions:
is this a realistic activity system to build?
How much of it is currently in place, and how much would you have to create?
For the capabilities you would need to build, is it affordable to do so?
If upon reflection, you find that the activity system isn’t feasible,
then you need to reconsider where to play and how to win.</p><p>When you have a feasible activity system, you can ask more questions:
is it distinctive?
Is it similar to or different from competitors’ systems?
This is an important point.
Imagine that a competitor has a different where-to-play and how-to-win choice,
but a very similar set of capabilities and supporting activities.
In such a situation, the competitor could shift to your potentially superior where-to-play and how-to-win choices
and begin to cut in to your competitive advantage.
If the activity system isn’t distinctive,
the where and the how and the map must be revisited until such time as a distinctive combination emerges.
As Porter notes, not all of the elements need to be unique or impossible to replicate.
It is the combination of capabilities, the activity system in its entirety, that must be inimitable.</p><p>When it has a feasible and distinctive activity system, you can ask, is the system defensible against competitive action?
If the system can be readily replicated or overcome,
then the overall strategy is not defensible and won’t provide meaningful competitive advantage.
In that case, you need to revisit your where-to-play and how-to-win choices
to find a set of strategic choices and an activity system that are difficult to replicate and hard to defend against.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Build activity systems starting at the ground level—the point of indivisible activity systems—and work your way up from there. Why? The capabilities at the indivisible level drive the ones above.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Es importante eliminar las actividades que no agregan valor <del>abajo</del>.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Activities that don’t add value to activity systems below should be minimized, because they destroy value.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>P&amp;G aggressively pruned businesses for which its five corporate capabilities couldn’t assist substantially in generating competitive advantage,
divesting about fifteen businesses a year for ten years, between 2000 and 2009.
Big, profitable brands such as Folgers and Pringles had to go
because they were not going to benefit from company reinforcement enough
to sustain competitive advantage over the long term.
Both had built strong brands,
but had limited opportunity for product innovation within P&amp;G’s mass channels of distribution.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We wanted to open dialogue and increase understanding through a balance of advocacy and inquiry.
This approach includes three key tools:
(1) advocating your own position and then inviting responses
(e.g., “This is how I see the situation, and why; to what extent do you see it differently?”);
(2) paraphrasing what you believe to be the other person’s view
and inquiring as to the validity of your understanding
(e.g., “It sounds to me like your argument is this; to what extent does that capture your argument accurately?”); and
(3) explaining a gap in your understanding of the other person’s views, and asking for more information
(e.g., “It sounds like you think this acquisition is a bad idea.
I’m not sure I understand how you got there. Could you tell me more?”).</p><p>These kinds of phrases, which blend advocacy and inquiry,
can have a powerful effect on the group dynamic.
While it may feel more forceful to advocate,
advocacy is actually a weaker move than balancing advocacy and inquiry.
Inquiry leads the other person to genuinely reflect and hear your advocacy
rather than ignoring it and making their own advocacy in response.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Taking a group of individual high achievers and asking them to work together to craft strategy is no simple matter.
Since strategic choice is a judgment call in which nobody can prove that a particular strategy is right or the best in advance,
there is a fundamental challenge to coming to organizational decisions on strategy.
Everyone selects and interprets data about the world
and comes to a unique conclusion about the best course of action.
Each person tends to embrace a single strategic choice as the right answer.
That naturally leads to the inclination to attack the supporting logic of opposing choices,
creating entrenchment and extremism,
rather than collaboration and deep consideration of the ideas.
To overcome this tendency, P&amp;G needed to create a culture of inquiry
and norms of communication that allowed individuals and teams to be more rather than less productive.</p></blockquote><h1 id=cómo-comunicar-la-estrategia><a href=#c%c3%b3mo-comunicar-la-estrategia alt>Cómo comunicar la estrategia</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><p>Comunicar una estrategia simple y clara.

Rather than attempting to bury real disagreements,
this approach surfaces differences and resolves them,
resulting in more-robust strategies and stronger commitment to them.</p></blockquote><h1 id=proceso-de-selección-estratégica><a href=#proceso-de-selecci%c3%b3n-estrat%c3%a9gica alt>Proceso de selección estratégica</a> <a href=# alt="Regresar al inicio">↑</a></h1><ol><li><p>Enmarcar la opción
