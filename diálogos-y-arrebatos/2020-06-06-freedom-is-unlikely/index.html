Diner parties which are described in the foreword to your book where friends enjoy debates and disagreements,
do you think in the broader conversation we&rsquo;ve lost that spirit
or [are] in danger of loosing it?</p><p>We are always in danger of loosing that spirit
because <strong>lack of freedom is more probable than freedom</strong>,
we have to be very careful to maintain that
because it&rsquo;s always under threat.</p><p>But I do think that it is under threat now,
I think that people are very careful about what they say in ways that aren&rsquo;t good.
I think that the fact that many comedians won&rsquo;t perform on university campuses now
it&rsquo;s a very good indication of that
that&rsquo;s a canary in the cole mine scenario.</p><p><a href='https://youtu.be/7QRQjrsFnR4?t=2463' target=_blank rel=noopener>Jordan Peterson</a></p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
