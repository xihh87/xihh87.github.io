Specifically,
take your current understanding of the laws of physics,
apply them in a new uncharted situation,
and ask whether they predict something interesting that we can observe.
Newton took the laws of motion that Galileo had established on Earth and extrapolated them to the Moon and beyond.
Friedmann took the laws of motion and gravity that Einstein had established in our Solar System and extrapolated them to our entire Universe.
Given how successful this mantra was, you might think that it would catch on as a meme in the scientific community.
In particular, you might think that after 1929 when Friedmann’s expanding-universe idea gained acceptance,
scientists around the world would race against each other to systematically explore what happened if you extrapolated it backward in time.
Well, if you’d have thought this, you’d have been wrong.…
No matter how emphatically we scientists claim to be rational seekers of truth,
we’re as prone as anyone to human foibles such as prejudice, peer pressure and herd mentality.
Overcoming these shortcomings clearly takes more than just talent for calculating.</p><p>Tegmark - Our mathematical universe.</p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
