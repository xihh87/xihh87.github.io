So it is worth noting three features of reputation:</p><p>(1) reputations emerge early and are quite stable over long periods of time;
(2) the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior,
reputations summarize past behavior,
so reputations are the best data source we have to predict behavior; and
(3) reputation forms the basis of everything that happens to us in life—people hire us, fire us, and loan us money based on our reputations.</p><p>Smart players in the game of life take very good care of their reputations.
Not so smart people are not as good at the care and feeding of their reputations.</p><p><a href=https://237jzd2nbeeb3ocdpdcjau97-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Reflections_Dark_Side.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>Reflections on the dark side - Dr. Robert Hogan</a></p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
