I think the world is a better place,
although it’s not always moving forward.
Looking at, say, international politics over the last ten years,
the consolidation of big media and the corrupting effects of that
have not been compensated for by the open network.
That’s a big disappointment.
Hundreds of thousands of people have died as a direct consequence of that.</p><p>That’s really sad.
I would like for the network to be doing a better job so that kind of stuff doesn’t happen again.
It’s not clear yet what transformations to the network have to occur in order to accomplish that.
And maybe it’ll be fine on its own, but I’m more pessimistic.
I think we need to figure out the next leap in order to overcome whatever is not working now.</p><p>Seibel: Wouldn’t the gazillion bloggers out there say,
“Hey, we’re out here blogging about everything and the mainstream media is taking it in the pants.”</p><p>Crockford: Yeah, that’s great. We still got it wrong.
We’ve got this great thing where we can all get wired together
and we can all get the message out to each other, but it’s not working.
It’s just a lot of noise at this point.</p><p>Seibel: And do you think that part of that solution of that problem will be technical?
Is there something programmers or system designers can do to tweak the architecture that will help?
Or is it a social problem?</p><p>Crockford: It may be that new social systems have to evolve on top of this new network infrastructure
and it’s just immature at this point and that’s why it’s not working.
Maybe it just solves itself. I’m hoping that’s the case.
But I think there may be more involved.
Right now, the network does an extremely poor job of identity,
does an extremely poor job of security,
and those are a necessary component, I think, of building robust social systems.
So that aspect of the Web is still deficient and maybe that’s why it’s so noisy still.</p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
