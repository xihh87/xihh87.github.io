practice is relegating the right amount of attention to the data
problem. This is something I discussed in two previous Dark Reading
columns about machine learning security, <a href=https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/building-security-into-software target=_blank rel=noopener>Building Security into
Software</a>
and <a href=https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/how-to-secure-machine-learning target=_blank rel=noopener>How to Secure Machine
Learning</a>. </p><p>You see, the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; in ML is really constructed directly from a bunch
of data.</p><p>My early estimations of security risk involved in machine learning make
the strong claim that data-related risks are responsible for 60% of the
overall risk with the rest of the risks (say, algorithm or online
operations risks) accounting for the remaining 40%. I found that both
surprising and concerning when I started working on ML security in 2019,
mostly because not enough attention is being placed on data-related
risks. But you know what? Even that estimation got things wrong.</p><p>When you consider the full ML lifecyle, data-related risks gain even
more prominence. That&rsquo;s because in terms of sheer data exposure it may
often be the case that putting ML into practice exposes even more data
than training or fielding the ML model in the first place. Way more.
Here&rsquo;s why.</p><p><strong>Data Involved in Training</strong></p><p>Recall that when you &ldquo;train up&rdquo; an ML algorithm - say using supervised
learning for a simple categorization or prediction task - you must think
carefully about the datasets you&rsquo;re using. In many cases, the data used
to build the ML in the first place come from a data warehouse storing
data that are both business confidential and carry a strong privacy
burden.</p><p>An example may help. Consider a banking application of ML that helps a
loan officer decide whether or not to proceed with a loan. The ML
problem at hand is predicting whether the applicant will pay the loan
back. Using data scraped from past loans made by the institution, an ML
system can be trained up to make this prediction.</p><p>Obviously in this example, the data from the data warehouse used to
train the algorithm include both strictly private information, some of
which may be protected (like, say, salary and employment information,
race, and gender), as well as business confidential information (like,
say, whether a loan was offered and at what rate of return).</p><p>The tricky data security aspect of ML involves using these data in a
safe, secure, and legal manner. Gathering and building the training,
testing, and evaluation sets is non-trivial and bears some risk.
Fielding the trained ML model itself also bears some risk as the data
are in some sense &ldquo;built right in&rdquo; to the ML model (and thus subject to
leaking back out, sometimes unintentionally).</p><p>For the sake of filling in our example, let's say that the ML system
we&rsquo;re postulating is trained up inside the data warehouse, but that it
is operated in the cloud and can be used by hundreds of regional and
local branches of the institution.</p><p>Clearly data exposure is a thing to think carefully about when it comes
to ML.</p><p><strong>Data Involved in Operations</strong></p><p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more. When an ML system like the one we&rsquo;re discussing
is fielded, it works as follows. New situations are gathered and built
into &ldquo;queries&rdquo; using the same kind of representation used to build the
ML model in the first place. Those queries are then presented to the
model which uses them as inputs to return a prediction or categorization
relevant to the task at hand. (This is what ML people mean when they say
auto-associative prediction.)</p><p>Back to our loan example, when a loan application comes in through a
loan officer in a branch office, some of that information will be used
to build and run a query through the ML model as part of the loan
decision-making process. In our example, this query is likely to include
both business confidential and protected private information subject to
regulatory control.</p><p>The institution will very likely put the ML system to good use over
hundreds of thousands (or maybe even millions) of customers seeking
loans. Now think about the data exposure risk brought to bear by the
compounded queries themselves. That is a very large pile of data. Some
analysts estimate that 95% of ML data exposure comes through operational
exposure of this sort. Regardless of the actual breakdown, it is very
clear that operational data exposure is something to think carefully
about.</p><p><strong>Limiting Data Exposure</strong></p><p>How can this operational data exposure risk built into the use of ML
be properly mitigated?</p><p>There are a number of ways to do this. One might be encrypting the
queries on their way to the ML system, then decrypting them only when
they are run through the ML. Depending on where the ML system is being
run and who is running it, that may work. As one example, Google&rsquo;s
BigQuery system supports customer-managed keys to do this kind of thing.</p><p>Another, more clever solution may be to stochastically transform the
representation of the query fields, thereby minimizing the exposure of
the original information to the ML's decision process without affecting
its accuracy. This involves some insight into how the ML makes its
decisions, but in many cases can be used to shrink-wrap queries down
significantly (blinding fields that are not relevant). Protopia AI is
pursuing this technical approach together with other solutions that
address ML data risk during training. (Full disclosure, I am a Technical
Advisor for Protopia AI.)</p><p>Regardless of the particular solution, and much to my surprise,
operational data exposure risk in ML goes far beyond the risk of
fielding a model with the training data &ldquo;built in.&rdquo; Operational data
exposure risk is a thing - and something to watch closely - as ML
security matures.</p></article></main></body></html>
