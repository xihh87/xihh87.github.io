He picked it up.
This was good - it was his quarter, fair and square, and it had cost him nothing.</p><p>From that moment on, he walked with his eyes surveying the ground for more treasure.
During his life, he found 387 pennies, 62 nickels, 49 dimes, 16 quarters, two half-dollars, and six one-dollar billsâ€”a total of $23.37.</p><p>The money had cost him nothing, except that he missed 28,742 beautiful sunsets, rainbows,
babies growing, birds flying, sun shining, and the smiles of the people around him.</p></article></main></body></html>
