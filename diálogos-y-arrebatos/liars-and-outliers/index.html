and it&rsquo;s not in the individual&rsquo;s short-term self-interest.
This problem is why cooperation is so rare in the natural world,
why it took so long to develop in humans,
and why we have developed societal pressures as a way to enforce cooperation and hold society together.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When nothing other than moral pressure influences a societal dilemma,
the number of defectors will be at its largest.
However, opportunities for individuals to make moral choices when they are unobserved
represent only a small portion of societal dilemmas.
We humans are a social species,
and more often than not someone is watching.
And that makes an enormous difference.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Throughout most of history, commerce was a local phenomenon.
Reputation made it work, and reputation was local.
The emergence of long-distance commerce in the Western world was aided in great part by the involvement of European Quakers, who earned a reputation for dealing honorably with their business partners.
Prior to the mid-17th century,
European traders ran a significant risk that trading partners from other countries would act in their own self-interest and renege on promises they had made;
overseas contracts were often unenforceable,
so the potential for profit often outweighed the likelihood of punishment.
However, the Quakers&rsquo; religious commitment to integrity and simple living,
and their belief in the essential worth of every individual, informed all of their business dealings.
Being upright with God was more important to them than making a fast buck.
The moral benefit they experienced from acting in accord with their consciences,
and the ensuing reputational benefits within both their religious and business communities,
outweighed any short-term financial gains that might have come from shady dealing.
A Quaker found to have dealt with others dishonestly ran the risk not only of losing business opportunities, but of being expelled from his religious community.
As a result, Quakers would cooperate even if it went against their self-interest,
and—as they consolidated their positions in industry—there was a gradual increase of trust in them among overseas traders.</p><p>The Quakers were an exception.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued
that mistrust increases in a community as ethnic diversity increases.
Evidence of this effect comes from sources as diverse as studies of carpooling,
Peruvian micro-credit cooperatives,
and Civil War deserters.
Even worse, this inherent mistrust of those in other ethnic groups
isn&rsquo;t offset by an increase in trust of those in one&rsquo;s own ethnic group;
trust across the board weakens in more ethnically diverse communities.</p><p>So it should come as no surprise that we have an enormous number of membership markers that we use to determine who is like us:
language, dress, ethnicity, gang tags, haircuts, tattoos, jewelry, T-shirt slogans, food choices, gestures, secret handshakes, turns of phrase in speech, formal membership credentials, and so on.
We generalize based on profession, city of residence, political affiliation, religious affiliation,
sexual orientation, interests, and pretty much any other category you can think of.
The theory is that all of these are vestigial remnants of prehistoric kin recognition mechanisms.
But while these might have worked better in our evolutionary past than they do today, our brains are still stuck on them.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Burglary has costs that exceed the value of the goods stolen. Burglary costs in the
time and effort to replace what&rsquo;s been stolen, the psychological effect of having one&rsquo;s
home violated, the cost to the community of investigating the crime and prosecuting
the accused, and even the cost of defending the suspect if he happens to be indigent.
Sometimes the costs to the burglarized far exceed the value to the burglar: think of
someone who steals copper wire out of a data center to sell as scrap metal, or destroys
a building to get at valuables inside. But these costs are not borne by the burglar. They
are externalities to him.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Financial rewards have the same effect that financial penalties do;
they engage the brain&rsquo;s greed system and disengage the moral system.
A fascinating incident in Switzerland illustrates this.
Trying to figure out where to put a nuclear waste dump,
researchers polled residents of several small towns about how they would feel about it being located near them.
This was 1993,
and a lot of fear surrounded the issue;
nonetheless, slightly more than half of the residents agreed to take the risk,
for the good of the country.</p><p>In order to motivate the other half,
the researchers offered money in exchange for siting the nuclear dump near them:
about $2,000 per person per year.
Instead of enticing more residents to accept the dump,
it reduced their number by half.
The researchers doubled and then tripled the amount offered,
but it didn&rsquo;t make a difference.
When they simply asked nicely,
the researchers stimulated the altruistic part of the residents&rsquo; brains—and, in many cases,
they decided it was the right thing to do.
Again, the addition of money can increase the defection rate.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>But more institutional pressure isn&rsquo;t always better.
Gary Becker won a Nobel Prize in economics
in part for his work in criminology.
He asked the obvious question,
what&rsquo;s the optimal level of crime?
The naive answer is zero,
but that is unattainable
and requires so much institutional pressure that society falls apart.
Too much institutional pressure,
and you get a country that looks like North Korea or the former East Germany:
police states with a good part of the population working for the police.
The other extreme—no police—doesn&rsquo;t work, either.
You get lawless countries like Afghanistan and Somalia.
Somewhere in the middle is the optimal scope of defection
and the optimal level of enforcement.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Either the law should be effective, or it shouldn&rsquo;t exist.
A law with a loophole is the worst of both.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Laws can be applied inconsistently.
If laws aren&rsquo;t objective, common, and universally Laws can be applied inconsistently.
If laws aren&rsquo;t objective, common, and universally applied, they are seen as unfair;
and unfairness can exacerbate the Bad Apple Effect.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Sometimes and for some people, laws aren&rsquo;t enough. Sometimes the incentives to defect
are worth the risk. That&rsquo;s where security technologies come in.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Foster empathy and community, increasing moral and reputational pressures.
In our large, anonymous society, it&rsquo;s easy to forget moral and reputational pressures
and concentrate on legal pressure and security systems.
This is a mistake;
even though our informal social pressures fade into the background,
they&rsquo;re still responsible for most of the cooperation in society.</p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
