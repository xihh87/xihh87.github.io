is that there is a correlation between how loudly someone proclaims his or her innocence and victimization,
and how responsible and guilty that person actually feels inside.
Most people can’t tolerate feeling guilty and self-blaming for long.
They either internalize or externalize it.
If they internalize it, they get depressed.
If they externalize it, they attempt to convince themselves and others
that they’re innocent victims and act martyred and blaming.
The unconscious message, then, is:
“I’m not guilty, I’m innocent;
I haven’t victimized anyone or done anything wrong,
I’m actually a helpless victim.
It’s your fault, not mine.”
Claims of innocence often reflect efforts to deny the opposite.
A modern compulsion to hold others responsible
—whether it’s parents, the “system,” or the government—
rather than ourselves
is actually a testament to how guilty we really feel, not how innocent.</p><p>Michael Bader</p></blockquote></article></main></body></html>
